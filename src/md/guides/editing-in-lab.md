# Editing XML texts in the St. Isidore of Seville research lab #


## Preparation ##

- Our editorial work is shared using repositories on `bitbucket.org`.  Please open a (free) account on bitbucket.
- If you do not already have an account in the Isidore of Seville research lab, you will need to create one.  Please read carefully:
    1. the lab [security requirements](http://shot.holycross.edu/isidore/security.html)
    2. guide to [choosing a secure password](http://shot.holycross.edu/isidore/passwords.html)


## Routine work procedure ##

1. On one of the client machines in the lab, log in as the user `oxygen`.  (You will be given the password to the oxygen account after you have established your own account on the server.)
2. From the Finder, choose "Connect to serverâ€¦", and connect to `afp://shot.holycross.edu`
3. Use your personal account on the server to connect to `shot.holycross.edu`:  you should then see a new icon on your Desktop with the contents of your personal account
4. As you work on your project, be sure to save all your editing work on *your* account, *not* on the `oxygen` account.  You should leave no files on the Desktop of the local `oxygen` account.
5. When you are through working, be sure to disconnect your account and log out.
