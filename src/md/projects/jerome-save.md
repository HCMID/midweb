Jerome's chronological tables align regnal sequences and historical events from many nations, with a running count of *anni mundi* (years since creation).  From the founding of the Olympic games, he adds a regular count of the Olympiad as well.  We'll begin our work with the founding of the first Olympic games:  in Geneva Ms. lat. 49, that begins with the bifolio spread 68 verso - 69 recto.  On St. Gallen, Vad.Slg. 298, that begins with the bifolio spread 43 verso -  44 recto.
