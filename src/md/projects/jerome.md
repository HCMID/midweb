# *Chronicles* of Jerome #

We are beginning work on two manuscripts of the *Chronicles*:

- Geneva Library, Ms. lat. 49 (late 15th century).
- St. Gallen Kantonsbibliothek, Vadianische Sammlung 298 (early 15th century). 


The archive of our work on Geneva 49 is available from [this github repository][1].  See the [wiki page there][2] for more information.
