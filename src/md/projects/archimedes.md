# Manuscripts of Archimedes #

The Archimedes team is currently focusing on parallel works of Archimedes in two manuscripts: the famous palimpsest, and the sixteenth-century Codex Bodmer 8.

The archive of our work is freely available from [this github repository][1]; for more information about our current work, see the [wiki there][2].
