*  CSS to style a specific layout and theme in a responsive

*  This layout alters the number of columns used in the
*  article[role = 'main'] depending on the results of
*  @media queries.
*  Maximum device size queried for is min-width=2080.

*  Some of this, including the magical font-size scaling
